  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Most developers like to spend a bit of time setting up their development workspace. I’m no different, after a number of years tweaking and experimenting the following article details how I setup my environment for Mavericks/Yosemite.</p>

<p>There has always been a consistent criteria my development environment needed to meet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unobtrusive, no modifying core files</li>
<li>Flexibility with Ruby versions</li>
<li>Minimal configuration</li>
<li>Easy to setup new/existing projects</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you’re a Ruby developer with the same ideals this should help you get started quickly.</p>

<p>This article assumes a clean install of Mac OS X Mavericks/Yosemite but I’ve added notes for Mountain Lion and those stuck on Lion should also be able to follow along.</p>

<h2>The Essentials</h2>

<h3>Install Command Line Tools</h3>

<p>Installation of Command Line Tools for Mavericks/Yosemite has changed from the previous versions, there is now a single command you can run in the terminal to trigger the install.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a pop-up window appear asking you to install, after clicking install just sit back and wait for it to finish.</p>

<p><strong>Mountain Lion:</strong> If you’re on Mountain Lion (or Lion) you will need to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads">download Command Line Tools</a> from Apple. The Apple Developer site requires you to sign in to access the downloads page but once you’re in search for the Command Line Tools for your version, download and install.</p>

<h3>What about Xcode?</h3>

<p>You can install <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> from the App Store but it’s not essential. I find the FileMerge application comes in very useful but it’s a large download just for that so be prepared to wait a little if you’ve not got a high-speed connection. Once it’s downloaded, launch Xcode to make sure it’s setup.</p>

<h3>Install Homebrew</h3>

<p>If you’ve not used <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> before you’re going to love it. The self proclaimed <em>missing package manager for OS X</em> allows us to easily install the stuff we need that Apple doesn’t include. Installation is simple, open Terminal (Applications » Utilities » Terminal) and copy this command:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>ruby -e <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>

<span class="c"># Add Homebrews binary path to the front of the $PATH</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH'</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Now check our environment is correctly configured for Homebrew.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew doctor
</code></pre>

<p>If there are any problems the <code>brew doctor</code> will give you details about the it and sometimes even how to fix it. If not your probably not the only one so look it up in Google.
Now we want to update Homebrew to make sure we’re getting the latest formulas:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew update
</code></pre>

<h3>Install Ruby</h3>

<p>OS X comes with Ruby installed (Mavericks/Yosemite even gets version 2.0.0, previously it was only 1.8.7), as we don’t want to be messing with core files we’re going to use the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build">ruby-build</a> to manage and install our Ruby versions for our development environment.</p>

<p>Lets get <em>brewing</em>! We can install both of the required packages using Homebrew, once done we add a line to our <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and reload our terminal profile.</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>brew install rbenv ruby-build rbenv-gem-rehash
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'eval "$(rbenv init -)"'</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
<span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>

<p>Now close terminal and open it again, this ensure everything has been reloaded in your shell.</p>

<p>The package we just installed allow us to install different versions of Ruby and specify which version to use on a per project basis and globally. This is very useful to keep a consistent development environment if you need to work in a particular Ruby version.</p>

<p>We’re going to install the latest stable of Ruby (at the time of writing) you can find this out by visiting the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby website</a>. Or to see a list of all available versions to install <code>rbenv install --list</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rbenv install 2.2.2
rbenv rehash
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s set this version as the one to use globally so we can make use of it in our terminal.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rbenv global 2.2.2
</code></pre>

<p>You can checkout more commands in the <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#command-reference">rbenv readme on Github</a>. It’s worth bookmarking that page for reference later, or there is always <code>rbenv --help</code>.</p>

<h3>Install Bundler</h3>

<p>Bundler manages an application’s dependencies, kind of like a shopping list of other libraries the application needs to work. If you’re just starting out with Ruby on Rails you will soon see just how important and helpful this gem is.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gem install bundler
</code></pre>

<p>We can also make use of the <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-default-gems">rbenv-default-gems</a> plugin to install bundler automatically for us whenever we install a new version of Ruby. I had some trouble with this working on the first version of Ruby you install but any others seemed to go ok.</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>brew install rbenv-default-gems
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"bundler</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.rbenv/default-gems
</code></pre>

<h4>Skip rdoc generation</h4>

<p>If you use Google for finding your Gem documentation like I do you might consider saving a bit of time when installing gems by skipping the documentation.</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"gem: --no-document</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.gemrc
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all, as you’ll see from <code>rbenv install --list</code> there are loads of Ruby versions available including <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a>. You will need to re-install any gems for each version as they are not shared.</p>

<h2>Install Ruby on Rails</h2>

<p>So far you’ve installed Ruby, if you’re not going to be working with Rails you can pat yourself on the back and start working with Ruby! If you intend to work with Rails then you’ve just got a couple more things to do.</p>

<h3>Install SQLite3</h3>

<p>SQLite is lightweight SQL service and handy to have installed since Rails defaults to using it with new projects. You may find OS X already provides an (older) version of SQLite3, but in the interests of being thorough we’ll install it anyway as Homebrew will set it to ‘keg-only’ and not interfere with the system version if that is the case.</p>

<p>Installation is simple with Homebrew: (<em>are you loving Homebrew yet!?</em>)</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install sqlite3
</code></pre>

<h3>Install Rails</h3>

<p>With Ruby installed and the minimum dependencies ready to go <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> can be installed as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Ruby Gem</a>.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>gem install rails
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like Rails to be a default gem in the future when you install a new version of Ruby you can add it to the <code>default-gems</code> file.</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"rails</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.rbenv/default-gems
</code></pre>

<p>Rails has quite a number of other gem dependencies so don’t be surprised if you see loads of other gems being installed at the same time.</p>

<h2>Your first Rails project</h2>

<p>Ready to put all this to good use and start your first project? Good, we’re going to create a new project called <code>helloworld</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rails new helloworld
cd helloworld
</code></pre>

<p>Now we’re going to set the local Ruby version for this project to make sure this stays constant, even if we change the global version later on. This command will write automatically to <code>.ruby-version</code> in your project directory. This file will automatically change the Ruby version within this folder and warn you if you don’t have it installed.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rbenv local 2.2.0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your gems start causing problems you can just run <code>gem pristine --all</code> to restore them to pristine condition.</p>

<p>Now let’s test our application is working:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>bin/rails server
</code></pre>

<h2>The Options Pack</h2>

<p>Below are some extras you may wish to install. Again <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to the rescue to make installation a breeze, so open your terminal and get brewing!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It’s recommended you run <code>brew update</code> before installing anything new to make sure all the formulas are up to date.</p>

<h3>Install MySQL</h3>

<p>One of the most commonly used SQL services, many projects end up using MySQL as a datasource. Homebrew does have formulas for alternatives such as <a href="http://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> if you prefer.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install mysql
mysql.server start
</code></pre>

<p>This will download and compile MySQL for you and anything else MySQL requires to work. Once finished the second command will <code>start</code> the MySQL service. If you want it to start every time you login check out <code>brew info mysql</code> for details.</p>

<p>To start a new Rails app with MySQL instead of the default SQLite3 as the datastore just use the <code>-d</code> flag like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rails new helloworld -d mysql
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more information about the other options available with <code>rails --help</code>.</p>

<h3>Install PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>OS X already comes with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> installed however as with Ruby it is an older version (again).
We want the latest so using Homebrew install PostgreSQL.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install postgresql
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
</code></pre>

<p>To start a new Rails app with PostgreSQL instead of the default SQLite3 as the datastore just use the <code>-d</code> flag like so:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>rails new helloworld -d postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>You can find more information about the other options available with <code>rails --help</code>.</p>

<h3>Install Redis</h3>

<p>All the cool kids are using <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> these days and for good reason. Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and sorted sets.</p>

<p>Redis is required by projects such as <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> for super fast storage.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install redis
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The above is usually fine but when you have a few projects on the go all using Redis you’ll want to have a project specific config for it so you can set a different port for example. Thankfully this is no problem, first take a copy of the default config.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cd /my/rails/project
cp /usr/local/etc/redis.conf ./config/redis.conf
</code></pre>

<p>With that done I usually commit the default into Git so it’s always there as a reference before I make any customisations. To launch a new Redis process using this config we need to call <code>redis-server</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>redis-server /my/rails/project/config/redis.conf
</code></pre>

<p>To connect to this custom Redis process instead of the default we need to use <code>redis-cli</code> with some extra flags:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>redis-cli --help
  Usage: redis-cli <span class="o">[</span>OPTIONS] <span class="o">[</span>cmd <span class="o">[</span>arg <span class="o">[</span>arg ...]]]
    -h &lt;hostname&gt;    Server hostname <span class="o">(</span>default: 127.0.0.1<span class="o">)</span>
    -p &lt;port&gt;        Server port <span class="o">(</span>default: 6379<span class="o">)</span>
    -s &lt;socket&gt;      Server socket <span class="o">(</span>overrides hostname and port<span class="o">)</span>
    ...
</code></pre>

<h3>Upgrade Git</h3>

<p>As with most of the packages on OS X the version of Git is a few versions behind. We can correct this however with a little help from Homebrew, and because we added the Homebrew binary location to the front of our <code>$PATH</code> the Homebrew version will be picked up first.</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install git
</code></pre>

<h3>What about the kitchen sink?</h3>

<p>That’s all you need for most Ruby on Rails applications. It has been serving me pretty well and meets all the requirements I outlined at the beginning of the article.</p>

<p>An alternative to <code>rbenv</code> is <a href="https://rvm.io/">rvm</a> the idea behind them both is the same but I find working with <code>rbenv</code> more comfortable but that maybe because I haven’t spent much time with <code>rvm</code>.</p>

<p>If you’re just starting out don’t worry there’s a lot to take in, start off with this setup and you’ll find your sweet spot as you get more experienced.</p>
